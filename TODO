Bug:
1. if commenting SpatialMaxPoolingPos and SpatialMaxUnpoolingPos, the program shuts down after a few mini-batches, saying there is an illegal access to cuda memory:

2. Setting nOutplan=20:
------ 
Larger batchSize, which is no less than 64, same thing would happen!!!
e.g, when batchSize = 64,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==> loading dataset
==> defining training procedure
==> doing epoch on training data:
==> online epoch # 1 [batchSize = 64]

--- cost: 6.7841898819092e+16..... 65/60000 ...................................] ETA: 9m31s | Step: 9ms

-->
• Could be the loss is too large...
• Cansed by ReLU()? Tried Sigmoid(), still not working with large batchSize
• Why did Thompson use Threshold(0,0) instead of ReLU()
• Can we make a dynamic batchSize which is enlarged after the loss is reduced to a stable range?
